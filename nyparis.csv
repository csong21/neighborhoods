Serving as Paris’ red-light district, this unapologetically coquettish neighborhood pursues more than deep pockets and affronting eroticism. Pigalle – Saint-Georges fosters other passions, too—Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh both painted here, local artisans make culinary delights by hand, and dedicated musicians can find antique instruments in this neighborhood’s specialty shops. Daytime is welcome in Pigalle – Saint-Georges, but the neighborhood truly comes to life after dark."

Once noted for its reckless abandon, Montparnasse&amp;#x27;s shops and brasseries now adhere to more professional tastes.
