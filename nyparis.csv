,quartier-latin,"Quartier Latin’s winding streets and warmly lit cafes inspire plein-air impressionism and late-night revelry. Revered for its bohemian beginnings, the neighborhood is frequented by students, thinkers, and travelers in the mood for ethnic eateries, challenging discourse, and cool nightlife. Second hand bookstores and first-rate dive bars snuggle together, often serving as platforms for feverish academic dialogues. Quartier Latin’s unassumingly hip demeanor permeates its surroundings, but the regality of Notre Dame is just a neighborhood away."
